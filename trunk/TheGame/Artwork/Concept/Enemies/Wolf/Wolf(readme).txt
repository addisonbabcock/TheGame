Allrighty, this is the model im going to base the wolf off of, This is one i found on turbo squid and the guy is giving it away for nothing no strings, I will be attempting my modeling of my own based off this, but my organic modelling free style isnt upp to par with things, evnviroments i can do, but a wolf on short notice for me is a bit of a stretch, Oh and whoever does the character sketches, if at all possible to do ortho-graphic views of him at atleast front and side and top would be great.
